This workshop is designed to educate engineers that might not be familiar with Amazon ECS, Fargate, and possibly even Docker container workflow.

## Amazon ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a **fully managed container orchestration** service. ECS has been a foundational pillar for key Amazon services, it can **natively integrate** with other services such as Amazon Route 53, Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch providing you a familiar experience to deploy and scale your containers. ECS allows your applications the flexibility to use a mix of **Amazon EC2** and **AWS Fargate** with Spot and On-Demand pricing options. 

## Purpose
- To understand Amazon ECS **fundermental concepts** and **new features**. 
- To practice **useful tools** for Amazon ECS **management**. 

## AWS services you will use
* Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* Amazon Elastic Container Resistry (ECR)
* AWS Fargate
* AWS FireLens
* Amazon CloudWatch
* Auto Scaling
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
